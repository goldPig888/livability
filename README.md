<h3>Climate-Induced Migration and Livability Concerns</h3>

Climate change is causing shifts in weather patterns, leading to extreme heat, rising sea levels, and an increased frequency of natural disasters. People face challenges in assessing the livability of a location due to uncertainties related to climate conditions.

### Specific Issues

1. **Increased Extreme Weather Events**: More frequent and severe weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires, impact the livability of certain areas.
2. **Rising Temperatures**: As global temperatures rise, certain regions may become less habitable due to extreme heat, affecting overall livability.
3. **Sea Level Rise**: Coastal areas are experiencing sea-level rise, posing a threat to communities and impacting the desirability of living in those locations.
4. **Shifts in Rainfall Patterns**: Changes in precipitation patterns can lead to water scarcity or excessive rainfall, affecting agriculture and water resources.

## Solution
